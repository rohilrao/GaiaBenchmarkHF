      "Perry: Old Movies, Rats, Journaling\n",
      "- Gift 6: “War and Peace” American film copy could be an old movie.\n",
      "- Gift 3: Raku programming guide doesn't fit Perry's interests. Maybe journaling relates to the film?\n",

      "But without knowing who was assigned where, it's impossible to say. However, perhaps the answer expects us to consider that since only 11 gifts were given out of 12 possible, one employee didn't give, and that would be Fred because his interests are more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Rebecca didn't receive anything, so her giver didn't give, making her the one not receiving. But the question is about who didn't give.\n",

      "4. **Kipchoge's average speed conversion**: If Kipchoge's pace is given in kilometers per hour, can we convert it to miles per hour or vice versa for easier calculations?\n",
      "5. **Time calculation unit**: Should we perform the time calculation in hours, minutes, or seconds? (Assuming we'll round to the nearest thousand hours)\n",
      "6. **Moon's orbital speed**: Is there a reliable estimate of the Moon's average orbital speed around Earth, which could help us compare Kipchoge's pace?\n",
      "7. **Kipchoge's endurance limit**: Is there any information on how long Eliud Kipchoge can maintain his record-breaking pace without rest or significant fatigue? (We'll assume this is the maximum duration for our calculation)\n",
      "8. **Speed conversion**: If we need to convert Kipchoge's pace from kilometers per hour to miles per hour or vice versa, are there any reliable online calculators or conversions available?\n",
      "9. **Earth-Moon distance variation**: How much does the distance between Earth and Moon vary due to lunar orbital eccentricity? Should we consider this factor in our calculation?\n",
